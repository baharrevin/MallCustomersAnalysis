# MallCustomersAnalysis
To group similar customers into clusters to support business decisions like marketing strategies and personalized campaigns

This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on: **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**

## Methods Used
- **Elbow Method**: To find the optimal number of clusters (k).
- **K-Means Clustering**: For unsupervised grouping of customers.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: To reduce dimensions and visualize clusters in 2D.

## Libraries
- `pandas` – data loading and processing  
- `matplotlib` – plotting graphs and visualizing clusters  
- `sklearn.cluster` – KMeans algorithm  
- `sklearn.decomposition` – PCA for dimensionality reduction
